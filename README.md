Grid-search is used to find the optimal hyperparameters of a model which results in the most ‘accurate’ predictions.

### Dataset
To dwell into the grid search we built a classification model on [*Breast Cancer dataset*](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28original%29)
